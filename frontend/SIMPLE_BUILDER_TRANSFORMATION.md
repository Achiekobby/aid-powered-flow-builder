### **🗣️ Simple Language Revolution**
```
❌ Old: "Configure Option Routing with Smart Pattern Recognition"
✅ New: "Connect your menu options"

❌ Old: "Enhanced Connection Management System"  
✅ New: "Add Menu → Get Input → End Message"

❌ Old: "Flow Validation with UX Analysis"
✅ New: "Test your phone menu"
```

### **🎮 One-Click Getting Started**
- **Interactive tutorial** with step-by-step guidance
- **Sample flow creation** for instant understanding
- **Visual hints and tips** throughout the interface
- **Floating help** that appears when needed

## 📱 **Three Simple Building Blocks**

### **1. 🔵 Menu Blocks**
- **Purpose**: Show options to users
- **Example**: "1. Check Balance, 2. Send Money"
- **Editing**: Click to add/edit options inline
- **Connections**: Drag dots to connect to next steps

### **2. 🟢 Input Blocks** 
- **Purpose**: Collect user information
- **Types**: Text, Number, Phone, Email, Amount, Date
- **Example**: "Enter amount: ____"
- **Smart**: Auto-suggests input types and validation

### **3. 🔴 End Blocks**
- **Purpose**: Show final message and end session
- **Types**: Success, Thank You, Goodbye, Rating
- **Example**: "Thank you! Your balance is $50.00"
- **Smart**: Pre-written professional messages
